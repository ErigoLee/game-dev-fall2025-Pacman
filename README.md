# Assignment 1 - Unity Review: Pacman
**Branch version:** `Version1`</br>
This branch contains the Pacman project for **Assignment 1 (Unity Review)**. </br>
https://github.com/ErigoLee/game-dev-fall2025-Pacman/tree/Version1</br>

**Game Description**
- The enemy moves using NavMesh and is coded to avoid obstacles.
- When the player collects a green item, they power up for a certain period of time, freezing the enemies. During this state, if the player collides with enemies, the enemies are destroyed and the player earns points.
- The player is coded based on the previously learned character controller.
- The game is cleared when all points are collected.
- If the player collides with enemies while not in the frozen state, their heart count decreases. After three collisions, the game is over.

**Game Description**
- Implemented an abstract Item class and created derived classes such as AppleItem and OrangeItem, which can be collected into the inventory.
- Added an Observer pattern in GameManager so that when the player collects inventory items or frozen enemies, they are added to the inventory.
- Integrated the Observer pattern in GameManager to update game UI and play sound effects when the player collects coins, obtains a big reward, or takes damage from enemies.
- Designed enemy behavior patterns using the IEnemyState interface, creating multiple state classes such as WaitState and AttackState.
